This is the source code used to load test Cute server (cuteserver.io)

Here, two libraries are built: the remote objects library loaded by
Cute server during tests and the client test app library.

The client app does not have its source available and can be downloaded
at: https://cuteserver.io/files/LoadTest/ClientTestApp.zip.

To make the client app use the new library, replace the old one located
at the client app's libs folder.

Client test app is built using Qt 6.2.

Cute client and server SDKs can be downloaded at cuteserver.io

If Cute Client SDK is located at /opt/Cute/SDK/Client/Qt6 and
Cute Server SDK is located at /opt/Cute/SDK/Server/Qt6, Qt
is installed at /opt/Qt/SDK/6.2.3/gcc_64 and this source is
located at ~/Programming/cute-load-test, then this project can
be built with the following commands:

cmake -DCUTE_CLIENT_SDK_DIR=/opt/Cute/SDK/Client/Qt6 \
      -DCUTE_SERVER_SDK_DIR=/opt/Cute/SDK/Server/Qt6 \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/Qt/SDK/6.2.3/gcc_64 \
      ~/Programming/cute-load-test

cmake --build .

Then, if the client test app is located at /opt/Cute/LoadTest/ClientTestApp,
then libClientLoadTestAppLibrary.so under /opt/Cute/LoadTest/ClientTestApp/libs
should be replaced with the newly built version.
